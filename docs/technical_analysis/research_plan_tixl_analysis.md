# TiXL Technical Architecture Analysis - Research Plan

## Task Overview
Conduct a comprehensive technical analysis of the TiXL codebase focusing on architecture patterns, code quality, technical debt, dependencies, and error handling strategies.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Architecture Patterns & Design Decisions
- [x] 1.1 Core module architecture analysis
- [x] 1.2 Operators module - plugin-based design patterns
- [x] 1.3 Gfx module - graphics pipeline architecture
- [x] 1.4 Editor module - UI framework patterns
- [x] 1.5 Gui module - component design patterns
- [x] 1.6 Cross-module communication patterns

### 2. Code Quality Assessment
- [x] 2.1 Naming conventions analysis across modules
- [x] 2.2 Method complexity and length analysis
- [x] 2.3 Class organization and structure review
- [x] 2.4 SOLID principles adherence evaluation
- [x] 2.5 Documentation and commenting quality

### 3. Technical Debt Identification
- [x] 3.1 Deprecated code detection
- [x] 3.2 Magic numbers and hardcoded values
- [x] 3.3 Code duplication analysis
- [x] 3.4 Maintainability issue identification
- [x] 3.5 Performance optimization opportunities

### 4. Dependency Management & Coupling Analysis
- [x] 4.1 External dependency assessment
- [x] 4.2 Internal module coupling analysis
- [x] 4.3 Circular dependency detection
- [x] 4.4 Interface/implementation separation review

### 5. Error Handling & Exception Management
- [x] 5.1 Exception handling patterns analysis
- [x] 5.2 Error recovery strategies review
- [x] 5.3 Logging and debugging support evaluation
- [x] 5.4 Resource management patterns assessment

### 6. Documentation & Reporting
- [x] 6.1 Compile findings and recommendations
- [x] 6.2 Create detailed technical analysis report
- [x] 6.3 Include specific code examples and metrics
- [x] 6.4 Provide actionable improvement recommendations

## Methodology
- Static code analysis using available file exploration tools
- Pattern recognition across module boundaries
- Metrics-based evaluation where possible
- Best practice comparison and gap analysis

# TiXL Performance and Scalability Analysis - Research Plan

## Objective
Conduct comprehensive performance and scalability analysis of TiXL system covering:
1. DirectX 12 graphics pipeline performance and optimization opportunities
2. Memory management patterns and potential memory leaks
3. Node editor performance with large graphs
4. Real-time rendering performance and frame rate optimization
5. Audio processing and synchronization performance
6. Plugin system performance and extensibility
7. Scalability limitations with large projects or complex scenes

## Research Strategy
### Phase 1: Information Gathering
- [ ] 1.1 Research TiXL project overview and architecture
- [ ] 1.2 Locate TiXL codebase or technical documentation
- [ ] 1.3 Identify key performance-relevant components
- [ ] 1.4 Understand system architecture and dependencies

### Phase 2: Technical Analysis
- [ ] 2.1 Analyze DirectX 12 implementation and graphics pipeline
- [ ] 2.2 Review memory management patterns and leak detection
- [ ] 2.3 Evaluate node editor performance characteristics
- [ ] 2.4 Assess rendering performance bottlenecks
- [ ] 2.5 Analyze audio processing architecture
- [ ] 2.6 Review plugin system design and performance
- [ ] 2.7 Identify scalability constraints

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization Recommendations
- [x] 3.1 Compile specific optimization recommendations
- [x] 3.2 Prioritize optimizations by impact and feasibility
- [x] 3.3 Create actionable implementation roadmap

### Phase 4: Report Generation

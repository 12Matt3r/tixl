# TiXL UI/UX Analysis Research Plan

## Task Overview
Evaluate the user interface and user experience of TiXL (Tooll 3) real-time motion graphics software, focusing on:
1. UI framework structure and component design in the Gui module
2. Editor interface and workflow efficiency
3. Accessibility features and compliance with accessibility standards
4. User workflow optimization opportunities
5. Visual design consistency and modern UI/UX best practices
6. Keyboard shortcuts, navigation patterns, and user interaction design

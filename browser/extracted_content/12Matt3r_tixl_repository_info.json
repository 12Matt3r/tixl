  "summary": "This GitHub repository, '12Matt3r/tixl', is a fork of the Tooll 3 (TiXL) project, an open-source software designed for creating real-time motion graphics. It targets a blend of real-time rendering, graph-based procedural content generation, and linear keyframe animation. TiXL enables artists to produce audio-reactive VJ content, utilize advanced interfaces for parameter exploration, and combine keyframe animation with automation. Technical artists can delve deeper for shader development (fragment/compute) and integrate inputs from MIDI controllers, sensors, OSC, or Spout. Version 4 is currently in active development, providing a stable platform for high-end visuals, motion graphics, and exporting standalone executables. The project aims to foster a community of artists, developers, and creative tinkerers.",
